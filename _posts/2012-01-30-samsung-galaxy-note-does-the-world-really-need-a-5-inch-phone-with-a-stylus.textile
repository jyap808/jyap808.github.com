bq. The Note’s gigantic 5.3-inch, Super AMOLED display makes it the largest “smartphone” we’ve seen so far. It’s practically a mini-tablet. In fact, a 5-inch touchscreen device, the Dell Streak, was marketed as a tablet in June 2010. But the Note is even larger. And it’s a smartphone. 

But the argument is that a 5.3 inch smartphone display gives you choice, right?

Isn't it a tautology to say that there will always be a market niche for a product no matter how impractical?
