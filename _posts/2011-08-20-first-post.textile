h1. {{ page.title }}

So I'm revisiting this post since it was originally just a 'test page'.

I had this grand idea of re-working my personal web site and having it be redirected to this GitHub hosted instance.  All very clean/elite and all.

But then I stumbled onto or more so realized that I had a road block.  Namely that of practicality.

I mean it meant that I needed to be on the command line to actually post and I needed to run Git commands to add files/posts and then push to the server.

I mean WordPress isn't clean/elite but at least you can edit through the web as well as optionally via a separate application.  So if the barriers to create are too high I may as well be using WordPress or Tumblr.

So I'm testing out "Cloud9 IDE":http://cloud9ide.com since it ties in nicely with GitHub repositories and covers the base of being able edit through the web.

.. And eventually if the whole workflow doesn't totally suck and enough content has been built up, I'll eventually shift my personal URL to point to this site.
