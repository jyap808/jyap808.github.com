h1. {{ page.title }}

Test new page created using Cloud9 IDE.

So Cloud9 has this command line at the bottom of the screen which allows you to 
run Git commands.

It doesn't have cut and paste in the editor...  Well paste works when pasting 
from another window but there is no way of originating a cut.

And I notice Cloud9 has this neat feature where there is a line which shows you 
you are reaching a certain column number.  I'm guessing 80 characters.

This page will probably be deleted.

This is for a future page.
