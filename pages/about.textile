h1. {{ page.title }}

I believe we live in interesting times.

I am an Australian expatriate, 10+ year IT professional specializing in Systems Engineering, VoIP and iOS development living in Honolulu, Hawaii.

By nature I think a lot.  Writing helps to clear my head.

What I aim to have on this site is my tech analysis, thoughts on future trends and other forms of pattern recognition.

Thanks.

This website is produced primarily on an Apple MacBook Pro Retina 13" 2013 model.

"Vim":http://www.vim.org/ is my only text editor.

I'm a big fan of the succinct and straightforward Textile syntax which was the markup language used to create this site. I have however reluctantly switched to using Markdown since it's become more of a standard.

This site runs "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/, the simple, blog aware, static site generator.

This site does not run any site analytics.
