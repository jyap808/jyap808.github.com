h1. {{ page.title }}

I believe we live in interesting times.

I am an Australian expatriate, 10+ year IT professional specializing in Systems Engineering, VoIP and "iOS development":https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/julian-yap/id428755113 living in Honolulu, Hawaii.

By nature I think a lot.  Writing helps to clear my head.

What I aim to have on this site is my tech analysis, thoughts on future trends and other forms of pattern recognition.

You can find me on "Twitter":http://twitter.com/jyap or "LinkedIn":http://www.linkedin.com/in/julianyap/.

Thanks.

This website is produced primarily on an Apple MacBook Pro Retina 13" 2013 model.

"Vim":http://www.vim.org/ is my only text editor.

I'm a big fan of the succinct and straightforward Textile syntax which was the markup language used to create this site. I have however reluctantly switched to using Markdown since it's become more of a standard.

This site runs "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/, the simple, blog aware, static site generator.

This site does not run any site analytics.
