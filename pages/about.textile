h1. {{ page.title }}

I believe we live in interesting times.

I am an Australian expatriate, 10+ year IT professional specializing in Systems Engineering, VoIP and "iOS development":https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/julian-yap/id428755113 living in Honolulu, Hawaii.

By nature I think a lot.  Writing helps to clear my head.

What I aim to have on this site is my tech analysis, thoughts on future trends and other forms of pattern recognition.

You can find me on "Twitter":http://twitter.com/jyap or "LinkedIn":http://www.linkedin.com/in/julianyap/.

Thanks.
